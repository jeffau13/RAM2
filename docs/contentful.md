9. Fill out the **Title**, **Description** & **Links** fields.

   - **Title** is used as a caption for the hover text scrambler effect
   - **Description** is only seen within the image viewer
   - **Links** is only used if the content is an animation/video on Youtube or Vimeo, the image viewer will embed the video linked.

10. Again, we need to publish the change.<br>
